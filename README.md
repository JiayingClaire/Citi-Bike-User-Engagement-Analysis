### Citi-Bike-User-Engagement-Analysis

#### Introduction & Goal of Study

Over the years, Citi bike has had its ups and downs, but as of October 2017, there are 706 stations, 12,000 bikes, and over 160K subscribers, making the service the largest bike sharing program in the United States.

One of the most intractable problems for Citi Bike is the issue of redistributing — or rebalancing — bicycles among stations in New York so that they are neither full nor empty. In addition, they need to **expand the user base and enhance the user engagement**.

The data set comes from the Citi Bike open source data that contains 348,257 entries and 15 variables from Nov, 2017 to October, 2018. To help solve the problem, we exam the features of usage seasonality, popular locations and user groups in the latest dataset.

#### Dataset
